    "Have you ever written an exciting piece of code, or automation, just to realize from somebody else that there's already an open source package available for that? That's how I felt when I first learned about Ansible automation, and how I had been wasting my time automating simple things that were already freely available to me. I want to set you up with the knowledge, and best tools available to easily deploy complex edge-to-cloud solutions like the Smart Village Platform. You can build your own solutions using the most up-to-date enterprise open source tools available, and I will show you how. \n",
